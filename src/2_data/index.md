# Reading and writing

This section will explore how to read and write data with Polars. It will focus mostly on `.csv` and `.parquet` data, using mainly the lazy `LazyFrame` (for larger-than-memory data).

* [Writing](writing.md)
* [Reading](reading.md)
* [Databases](databases.md)

Since you have to write data to read it, and read data to write it, these two sections are interdependent.
