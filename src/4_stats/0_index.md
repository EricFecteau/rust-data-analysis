> [!CAUTION]
> This section focuses on *how* to do summary statistics, hypothesis testing and modelling in Rust, with special attention on how to modify the data for this to work. It does not focus on the validity of the results for the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The interpretability of the results when replicating these examples with your data will depend on, among many other things, the survey design, the quality and representativeness of the sample, the appropriateness of the statistical methods used, the assumptions underlying those methods and the context of the data being analyzed.
